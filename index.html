      <h2>My Journey Learning to Draw Anime</h2>
  <p>
    I've loved anime ever since I was a kid the unique art styles, the emotional stories, and the powerful characters always inspired me. But I never thought I could actually draw anime myself... until I finally gave it a try.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started with simple sketches just copying characters from shows like Naruto, Demon Slayer, and Attack on Titan. My first drawings were really rough, but I didn‚Äôt give up. I kept practicing, watching YouTube tutorials, and learning the basics: face proportions, eye placement, and body shapes.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the biggest challenges I faced was drawing facial expressions. Anime is so expressive, and it took me a while to learn how to show emotion through eyes and mouth shapes. But slowly, I got better.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I‚Äôm learning digital art too. I use free tools like <strong>Medibang Paint</strong> and sometimes just draw on paper and scan it. Every week, I try to draw at least one new character or emotion. It's part of my personal growth as both an artist and a web developer since I built this blog myself!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're someone who wants to start drawing anime but feels unsure  just begin. You don‚Äôt need fancy tools or perfect talent. All you need is a pencil, time, and patience. Trust me, if I can learn, so can you!

      <h2>5 Mistakes I Made as a Beginner Anime Artist (And How I Fixed Them)</h2>
  <p>
    When I first started drawing anime, I made a lot of classic beginner mistakes. From drawing eyes too big to forgetting proper face proportions, it was a mess.

  <h2>My Favorite Anime Characters to Draw (And Why)</h2>
  <p>
    Some characters are just fun to draw ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs their unique hairstyle, intense expressions, or detailed outfits. In this post, I‚Äôll show you which anime characters I enjoy sketching the most and what each one teaches me as I improve my art style.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Naruto Uzumaki (Naruto)</h3>
  <p>
    Naruto is one of the first characters I ever tried to draw. His spiky hair, ninja headband, and expressive eyes make him a perfect character for practicing energy and motion. Plus, I love drawing his facial expressions they range from goofy to powerful.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Nezuko Kamado (Demon Slayer)</h3>
  <p>
    I enjoy drawing Nezuko because her character design is both cute and fierce. Her bamboo mouthpiece and detailed kimono are great for practicing clothing folds and patterns. She also helps me work on softer facial expressions and delicate linework.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Levi Ackerman (Attack on Titan)</h3>
  <p>
    Levi is great for learning how to draw clean, sharp features and intense expressions. His cold, focused stare is a fun challenge. Drawing his Survey Corps uniform also helps me improve my ability to draw layered clothing and belts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drawing these characters over and over not only helps me improve my skills but also reminds me why I love anime art in the first place. Which characters do you love to draw? Let me know in the comments!

  <h2>Top 3 Free Tools I Use to Draw Anime Digitally</h2>
  <p>
    You don‚Äôt need expensive programs to start drawing anime digitally. In fact, I started using completely free tools and I still use them today. In this blog, I‚Äôll walk you through my top 3 free drawing apps and how each one helped me level up my digital art.
  </p>

  <h3>1. MediBang Paint</h3>
  <p>
    MediBang Paint is one of the best beginner-friendly tools for anime artists. It has tons of brushes, layers, and even comic tools. I love using it because it‚Äôs lightweight, cloud-based, and totally free.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Krita</h3>
  <p>
    Krita is more advanced and offers a professional set of tools all for free. I use it when I want to add detailed shading and paint-like effects to my anime characters. It‚Äôs especially great for coloring and working on large canvases.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Autodesk SketchBook (Free Version)</h3>
  <p>
    SketchBook has a smooth, intuitive interface that feels great for sketching. I often use it for rough drafts or line art. It‚Äôs great for beginners who want a simple, clean workspace to draw without distractions.
  </p>

  <p>
    These tools helped me improve a lot ‚Äî and the best part? You don‚Äôt have to spend a single rupee to get started. Just download, start drawing, and have fun!

  <h2>How I Plan My Anime Drawing Practice Each Week</h2>
  <p>
    Staying consistent is the hardest part of learning any skill. That‚Äôs why I created a weekly drawing routine that helps me stay on track. In this post, I‚Äôll share how I plan my art practice, what I focus on each day, and how I keep things fun and challenging.
  </p>

  <h3>üóì My Weekly Drawing Schedule</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Practice anime eyes and facial expressions</li>
    <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Sketch full characters in simple poses</li>
    <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Study anatomy (hands, legs, body shapes)</li>
    <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Focus on hair and hairstyles</li>
    <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Color and shade one character</li>
    <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Free drawing or fan art</li>
    <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Rest day or review old sketches</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I try to spend at least 30 minutes a day drawing. Even on busy days, a quick sketch keeps me in the habit. Having a routine helps me improve faster without feeling overwhelmed.

  <h2>From Pencil to Screen: How I Turn My Sketches into Digital Art</h2>
  <p>
    I often start my anime art with pencil sketches on paper. But to bring them to life, I digitize them and add color and detail. In this blog post, I‚Äôll show you my step-by-step process from paper to screen.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 1: Sketching with Pencil</h3>
  <p>
    I start with a light pencil sketch in my notebook. I focus on the pose and face ‚Äî no details yet. I keep it simple and clean so it‚Äôs easy to trace later.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2: Scanning or Taking a Photo</h3>
  <p>
    I use my phone to take a clear photo or scan the drawing. Then, I transfer it to my laptop or tablet. Make sure the lighting is good so the lines are visible.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3: Tracing and Line Art</h3>
  <p>
    I open the image in MediBang or Krita and reduce the opacity. Then I use a new layer to trace the final line art using a digital brush. This step really cleans up the drawing.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4: Coloring and Shading</h3>
  <p>
    Once the line art is done, I add base colors, then shadows and highlights. I experiment with different color palettes depending on the mood of the drawing.
  </p>

  <p>
    It‚Äôs amazing to watch a simple paper sketch turn into a colorful digital illustration. This process lets me combine traditional and digital art skills!

  <h2>My Anime Drawing Goals for the Next 3 Months</h2>
  <p>
    I believe that setting clear goals is the key to improving any skill and anime art is no different. Over the next 3 months, I want to focus on specific areas in my drawings so I can level up my skills and become more confident as an artist. Here's what I'm working on and how I plan to stay consistent.
  </p>

  <h3>üéØ Skills I Want to Improve</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Drawing Hands:</strong> I still find hands tricky! I want to practice different hand poses every week.</li>
    <li><strong>Action Poses:</strong> I want to draw more dynamic scenes with movement instead of just standing poses.</li>
    <li><strong>Shading and Lighting:</strong> I want to learn how to use shadows and highlights to make my drawings look more 3D.</li>
    <li><strong>Character Outfits:</strong> I‚Äôll focus on drawing clothes with folds, patterns, and accessories.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üìÜ Weekly and Monthly Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    To stay on track, I‚Äôve created a simple challenge schedule:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>October:</strong> Draw 10 different hand poses + 3 full-body action scenes</li>
    <li><strong>November:</strong> Focus on shading complete 5 shaded portraits using different lighting angles</li>
    <li><strong>December:</strong> Design and draw 2 original characters (OCs) with full outfits</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>ü§ù Join Me on This Journey!</h3>
  <p>
    If you're also working on your anime art, let‚Äôs grow together! You can follow this same challenge or create your own. Comment your goals below, or tag me if you post your drawings online. Let's keep each other motivated!
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll be sharing updates here every few weeks to show how I'm doing ‚Äî including sketches, progress shots, and lessons learned. Let‚Äôs keep drawing!
