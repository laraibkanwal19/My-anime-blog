  <h2>About This Blog</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Laraib Kanwal — a computer science student and self-taught anime artist. I started this blog to share my personal journey of learning how to draw anime from scratch. Drawing has always been something I admired in anime shows, but I never imagined I’d be able to create my own characters and expressions.
  </p>

  <p>
    On this blog, you’ll find beginner-friendly tips, my favorite drawing tools, practice routines, and sketches from my improvement journey. I also talk about challenges I face and how I overcome them, so that other aspiring artists like you can learn and grow with me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're just starting out or already love anime art, I hope this blog inspires you to pick up a pencil (or tablet!) and draw what you love.
